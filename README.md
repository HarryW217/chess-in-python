# Chess in Python using Pygame!

## You say "Wanna play Chess?", and my answer is "Yes!"

Chess is the greatest game there is. In an effort to improve my Python skills, I thought it would be a tonne of fun to recreate the game using the language. 

Following along with a tutorial from Youtuber [LeMaster Tech](https://www.youtube.com/@lemastertech), this project allows users to play a two-player Chess game. You can move all the pieces in the usual ways, view them as cool assets (also provided by LeMaster) on a drawn Chess board, and when a King is in check, a red boarder will flash on it's square indicating trouble!

In addition, captured pieces can be seen on the right side of the screen to emulate a real Chess game where this material would be placed to one side, and players can resign if they wish, declaring their opponent the winner. 

In a twist from traditional Chess, this game grants a player a winner when the King is taken by the opposing team, rather than put in Checkmate. I attemped to implement Checkmate functionality to complement the existing project, which you can currently see in [another branch](https://github.com/HarryW217/chess-in-python/tree/alternative-checkmate-functionality) that I may develop on in the future!

Special thanks to LeMaster Tech, whose tutorial I followed along with this recreate this Chess game and inspired me to look into alternative functionality! You can watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-e0jk4I938&t=7465s
